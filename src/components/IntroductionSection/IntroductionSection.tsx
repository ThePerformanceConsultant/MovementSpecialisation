        <h2>Understanding Your Unique Anatomy</h2>
        <p>
          This calculator is designed to help you gain an appreciation for the <strong>anatomical structures you were born with</strong>—proportions that cannot be changed through training. By understanding your unique skeletal framework, you can develop insight into how your body naturally interacts with different movement patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your individual makeup means you are inherently <strong>better suited to some movements and muscle groups than others</strong>. For example, someone with longer femurs relative to their torso will find squatting more challenging, whilst excelling at hip-hinge movements. Conversely, those with shorter limbs may find pressing easier but struggle to fully engage their lats during pulling exercises.
        </p>
        <p>
          These structural biases can lead to <strong>over-reliance on certain muscle groups</strong> during compound movements—often without you realising it. Over time, this can result in overuse of dominant muscles and underuse of others, potentially leading to <strong>muscular imbalances, movement dysfunctions, and increased injury risk</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          By understanding your proportions, you can take a <strong>constructive and proactive approach</strong> to your training: selecting exercise variations that work with your anatomy, addressing weak points before they become problems, and ultimately making your training more personalised, effective, and sustainable in the long term.
